<p> I was wandering through the high grass of twitter when I stumbled upon this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    Can someone make a logo &amp; banner for vitasdk? Nothing copyrighted/trademarked please!</p>&mdash; Yifan (@yifanlu)

</blockquote>

So, yeah, I liked the idea, why not ? It's been quite some time since I've been following the underground console hacking scene, why not give something back? even if it has a tiny impact. Immediately, I fired up CorelDraw and started sketching, then came up with a not so interesting design. </p>

<p> I was thinking about the "movements" of a program from state to state, hence the arrows. <a href="https://twitter.com/yifanlu">@yifan</a> response was an implicit "meh", after staring at the logo for a while, my own response changed to an explicit "meh". Some guys were experimenting with the vita handheld shape, <a href="https://twitter.com/yifanlu">@yifan </a> seemed to like the idea.</p>
<p> I thought better, after all, the bulk introduced by the shape of the vita would make an ugly logo, that's what I thought. So I abstracted the vita shape into a combination of well known programming elements. <em> On a side note, the choice of colors was influenced by two facts; (1) the PlayStation&reg; brand main color, and (2) it's my preferred color :P</em></p>

<p>If you ask me, It's an interesting logo, although somewhere on the edge between cool and ugly. I didn't want to use someone's idea of incorporating the vita shape, this would bring back some very painful memories where I've been the victim of daylight plagiarism, and I didn't want anyone to experience the pain.</p>
<p>So, I waited for the one who introduced the idea to make a refined logo, nothing showed up. This is when <a href="https://twitter.com/yifanlu">@yifan </a> asked me directly if I can incorporate the vita shape into the logo. I had some doubts, I wanted to create the most awesome logo possible. The vita shape was a hindrance, and sometimes, the client's (<a href="https://twitter.com/yifanlu">@yifan</a>'s) suggestions go against the message he intends to transmit through his product's (<a href="https://vitasdk.org/">vitasdk</a>'s) logo.</p> 
<p>Vitasdk is an essential tool specific to vita homebrew developers, I thought to myself, a vita shape in the logo would make it look very generic and confuse a lot of non-developers ! But, hey, <a href="https://vitasdk.org/">vitasdk</a> is meant for developers ! why would I care about non-developers, It's not like they could "download" <a href="https://vitasdk.org/">vitasdk</a> as a simple app/vpk and "install" it in their PSVita ! No way, let's calm down and incorporate the vita shape, just focus on making it look nice, okay ? A quick trace of a Vita promotional image did the trick.</p>

<img src="/images/content/vsdk3.png" alt="vsdk logo prototype 2" class="content-image" />

<p>There you go ! Thankfully, <a href="https://twitter.com/yifanlu">@yifan</a> did not specify how I should incorporate the vita shape, so I took the liberty to overflow the "sdk" acronym away from the screen, since hackers like things that overflow, and to make the "sdk" part the most prominent. In the end, <a href="https://twitter.com/yifanlu">@yifan</a> seemed to like the logo, he wanted me to incorporate some programming/dev elements, obviously. </p>
<p>This should have been the primary focus, I thought. But well, someone like him surely knows what he's talking about. This wasn't easy, too many possibilities arose. I didn't want to mess too much with the large parts of the logo, I decided to augment it by only adding elements that shouldn't distort the overall look, but maybe make it prettier, and convey the programming message on the way.</p>

<img src="/images/content/vsdk-protos1.png" alt="vsdk logo protoype 3" class="content-image" />

<p>Braces, hash, semicolon and asterisks, probably the most prominent characters in a C program. The logo felt a little bit cluttered, but somewhat, it started to convey that programming feel <a href="https://twitter.com/yifanlu">@yifan</a> was after, especially N°1 where the logo is wrapped inside braces, similar to a block of code in a C program, and N°4 where the word "vita" is followed by (); to convey a function call. </p>
<p>This was probably a step in the right direction, I said, I only need to do more refinements, maybe dig a little deeper. This is where the second system effect kicked in. Let's add more details to the vita shape, use cooler fonts and enhance the colors. I figured, to convey a programming/dev feel, I don't need to glue hundreds of KLOCs to the logo, instead, let's use the single most common element in a C program; the braces. The results were nice. (though I didn't have to close the braces, don't worry, I don't intend to compile a logo) </p>

<img src="/images/content/vsdk-protos2.png" alt="vsdk logo prototype 4" class="content-image"/>

<p> I toyed with various levels of details for the vita for each prototype as well as different fonts and positions of the "sdk" part. A couple of tweets mentioned N°3 as being the best looking of the lot, and I seemed to lean toward that way too, after all, the logo looked more symmetrical because of the well balanced font, and the vita wasn't too cluttered with details.</p>
<p>This combination of elements created a well balanced and clean logo that seemed to be inching closer to target. <a href="https://twitter.com/yifanlu">@yifan</a> had other thoughts, he tweeted that he liked the minimalism of the previous prototypes and the colors of this prototype. Interesting, lets combine both ideas. I only had to tone down the details and keep the coloring, while still conveying the programming feel, easy.</p>

<img src="/images/content/vsdk13.png" alt="vsdk logo prototype 5" class="content-image" />

<p>I took the chance to make the logo more symmetrical. The end result was quite interesting, it still needed some subtle refinements, but overall, this looked like a cool logo for an awesome project. But, the developers saw otherwise, I don't know the details, but maybe they wanted to keep it as simple as possible, "simple is better than complicated". I can't disagree with that. <a href="https://twitter.com/devnoname120">@devnoname120</a> asked me to use the first vita shape prototype as is and just don't overflow the "sdk" from the vita screen. Enough with overflows.</p>

<p>Moments after that, <a href="https://twitter.com/yifanlu">@yifan</a> said that everyone agrees on that logo. That was a delight to hear. A good developer will always choose the simplest solution instead of a more complicated one, that's a well known fact among programmers. <a href="https://twitter.com/yifanlu">@yifan</a> and co are well beyond the standards of a good developer, this principle must have been ingrained in their very bones, to the point that it'll affect their everyday decisions. The decision for <a href="https://vitasdk.org/">vitasdk </a> logo wasn't an exception.</p> 
<p>Usually, I design logos for small and medium sized companies through logo design contests. Designing a logo for a project related to a console hacking scene was a dream I never dared to think about. So my thanks go to all the devs involved in the vita hacking scene, and to <a href="https://twitter.com/yifanlu">@yifan</a> exceptionally. This is a start.</p>
