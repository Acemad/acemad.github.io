*(download link below)*

One upon a time, there was a video game that had another video game as a DLC. That DLC was quite surprising, it was a completely standalone game that even rivaled the original in quality. (IMHO) 

<!--more-->

The game was FarCry 3 and the DLC was FarCry 3 : Blood Dragon. So what's the relationship with VitaShell? you might ask. Lets say VitaShell lacks some neon lights :) Have a look at the image below.

Blood Dragon had a very interesting color palette that I found really refreshing for a game set in a retro-futuristic universe. The execution was simply fascinating and consistent across the entire game and promotional media. 

So why not (try to) bring that awesome color palette to VitaShell? It'd be right at home, right? neon lights, laser beams and 3D wireframes ! Anyone? Enter NeonRift ;) a theme inspired from that color palette.

### Boot Screen *(optional)*

This would appear immediately after launching VitaShell, sort of a loading screen. I highly recommend.

### How to install ? (On top of default VitaShell)

- Download NeonRift.zip from the link below.
- Copy the 'NeonRift' folder inside the downloaded zip to `ux0:VitaShell/theme/`
- Switch to NeonRift theme from VitaShell settings. Restart VitaShell. Enjoy.
- *(Optional)* If you would like to install the LiveArea theme, bubble and **Boot Screen** (which I recommend), just copy the 'VITASHELL' folder to `ur0:appmeta/` and `ux0:app/` and make sure to confirm any overwrite.
