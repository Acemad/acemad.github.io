Inspired by the red clouds, alwyas prominent on the Akatsuki's *(Naruto anime)* garb, this theme is a fork of Electron, adorned with a darker tone.

**Update 31/08/2018** : Theme updated to accommodate the new settings entry in VitaShell 1.95. Enjoy !

Red and black go together really well, and I had this idea for a red and black VitaShell theme for a while, then I remembered the actual evil organization wearing the same colors, so I just borrowed the cloud and name and designed the theme on top of Electron. That's how it was born.

I really want to see it on a red Vita !

### How to install ? (On top of default VitaShell)

- Download Akatsuki.zip from the link below.
- Copy the 'Akatsuki' folder inside the downloaded zip to `ux0:VitaShell/theme/`
- Switch to Akatsuki theme from VitaShell settings. Restart VitaShell. Enjoy.
- *(Optional)* If you would like to install the LiveArea theme and bubble, just copy the 'VITASHELL' folder to `ur0:appmeta/` and make sure to confirm any overwrite.

*This theme was 90% done last year, I just could not finish it and release it in time due to some special circumstances. Anyway, now it is ready, please enjoy.*
